# Web-Scraping: Books to Scrape
---
For my first web-scraping project I used the **requests** and **BeautifulSoup4** modules. I simply scraped one of the web-pages availabe at **to.scrape.com** called
'Books to Scrape' and retrieved the titles of the books that had 4 or 5 stars in their reviews.

### Documents
I have uploaded the code I used (_web_scraping.py_) and my notes on web-scraping (_DÃ­a 11 - Web Scraping_).
